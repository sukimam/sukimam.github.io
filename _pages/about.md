<p style="text-align: justify;">
 am a Computer Scientist currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science, driven by a profound passion for the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). These fields represent not just cutting-edge technology but also powerful tools for addressing some of the most pressing challenges of our time.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My research is focused on advancing NLP, with a particular emphasis on low-resource languagesâ€”those spoken by underrepresented linguistic communities that are often overlooked in the digital era. These languages, though rich in cultural heritage, lack the computational resources necessary to fully participate in modern technological advances. I aim to bridge this gap by designing innovative approaches that tackle data scarcity and improve accessibility, ensuring that no language or community is left behind in the AI revolution.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
With a deep commitment to academic excellence, I thrive on exploring complex, innovative ideas and translating them into actionable research. Writing journal articles is not just a professional obligation but a personal passion, allowing me to synthesize intricate concepts into clear, impactful contributions to the academic and technological communities. For me, the written word is a medium for collaboration, inspiration, and driving progress across disciplines.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
As I navigate the ever-evolving landscape of AI, I am dedicated to addressing real-world challenges with impactful and inclusive solutions. My mission is to contribute to the transformative potential of technology by making it more equitable, accessible, and reflective of the diverse tapestry of human languages and cultures. Through my work, I strive to build a future where AI empowers everyone, transcending barriers and fostering a truly interconnected world.
