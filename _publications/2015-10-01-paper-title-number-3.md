ABSTRACT
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
The rapid spread of deceptive news especially in Africa has become a
global issue in last decade. This triggers the attention of the research community
to develop efficient and reliable classification approaches for fake news detection
so as to prevent its spread in the community. It has been explored that fake news
in regional languages spread with a faster pace as compare to English language in
local regions. Hausa is a very common language in Nigeria and some West African
countries. So, it opens the challenge to detect the fake news in Hausa language.
This paper presents the first corpus for the detection of fake news in Hausa. A
dataset has been formed by collecting the labeled real and fake news consists of
2600 articles. In order to classify the fake news in Hausa, six different classifiers have
been utilized. The performance of these approaches is then evaluated over different
metrics and compared to determine the best model on the Hausa language dataset.
The experimental results indicate that support vector machine (SVM) outperformed
the other classifiers used by achieving 85% accuracy while AdaBoost happens to
emerge as the fair model with 70% accuracy.
