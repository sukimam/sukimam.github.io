<p> KEY INSIGHT </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The paper The State of the Art of Natural Language Processing-A Systematic Automated Review of NLP Literature Using NLP Techniques provides a comprehensive overview of the rapidly growing field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in artificial intelligence. The study aims to capture meta-level knowledge, analyze existing literature, and promote transparency and accessibility through full automation. It also serves as a guide for using basic NLP tools, beneficial for researchers entering the field.

The paper uses various methods to analyze NLP literature, including text extraction, cleaning and preprocessing, keyword and keyphrase searches, text embeddings, summarization, text complexity analysis, clustering and metadata analysis, and network visualization. It extracts relevant text, cleans and preprocesses it, categorizes topics, and uses both abstractive and extractive summarization methods. The complexity of texts is analyzed to understand the readability and depth of the literature. Unsupervised clustering and metadata analysis are used to group similar papers and identify influential works. Network visualization helps understand the structure of the NLP research community.

The paper makes several significant contributions to the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It presents a systematic review of Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature, capturing the current state of the field. It captures meta-level knowledge about trends, methodologies, and key research areas. The paper also provides guidance on basic NLP tools, making them accessible to a broader audience. The review process is automated, reducing time and effort required for literature reviews. The paper identifies influential works in NLP through citation networks, highlighting research gaps and encouraging exploration in underrepresented areas. The visualization of citation networks helps understand the structure of the NLP research community and the flow of ideas.

The paper The State of the Art of Natural Language Processing-A Systematic Automated Review of NLP Literature Using NLP Techniques presents several key findings and results from its analysis. It analyzes 4,712 scientific papers using various NLP methods. The analysis aims to answer six research questions, identify popular tasks and problems, and examine the citation network of the top 10% of highly cited papers in NLP. The findings suggest a competitive and progress-focused nature in NLP research, with limited space for exploratory or non-results-oriented research. The paper also provides a guide to basic NLP tools, making them publicly available for future research applications.
